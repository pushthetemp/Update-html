                Retail is in decline, well, so they say. But why do they say this though?<br> 
                Because what you get online is much quicker, easier, and I guess, much more
                enjoyable than what you would have to face in the store, giving us less reason
                to venture out. Right? 
            </p>


            <p id="copy">
                Hold one second- "store". When we think of this word I can bet not may of us have
                dynamic images in our heads. I bet there's the isles, shelves, counter, register,
                a big window, a bunch of posters and maybe a slight theme running though it. Or,
                I won't be too negative, maybe there's a strong, interesting, vibrant theme, however
                the way the activity is being implemented/played out is much the same as it was back
                in 1610. Find what you want, take it off the shelf, shimmy over to the merchant, pay,
                then out you go.  Based on that, why wouldn't you just do it online, what you're doing
                is so monotonous anyway. Then you have the folks over at Amazon  thinking different.
                And that's what this article is about, bringing difference in a world of sameness when
                it comes to retail.
            </p>

            <p id="copy">
                Lets jump back over to the amazon thing and see why they're showing us something slightly
                different. I said above the basic steps when you walk into a store. With Amazon Go
                (that's its name) you skip the part of going to the merchant, and just go. Nothing to it.
                It's like having a gigantic pantry I guess you could say. 
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
                However, what they what people do in the store is the same as any other super market. I don't
                see myself running over to an amazon Go any time soon- unless I really need something. In fact,
                I may find it a little worrying because I don't even apply the motion to implement contactless
                anymore, at least with that you can feel yourself spending increasing amounts. Followed by the
                realisation of your ludicrously large bill when you next check your phone. As I initially said, at least Amazon
                are keeping to the spirit of bringing difference in a world of sameness and bringing
                us the future store. 
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
                Retail shouldn't just be seen as a place to purchase items, It should be more of a journey and
                experience into a new world. Especially now more than ever with online doing an amazing job of
                solving problems  in style . We used to walk miles to go to town because we could hold something
                that we've never held before, see something we've never seen before, interact with people we've
                never interacted before. The keyword back then was NEW. New is harder to achieve now. Different,
                I think is a much more achievable goal. You can make an environment different, you can make the
                way you transverse around different, like with Amazon, you can make the payment method different.
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
                With the development of future technologies being brought to the public at an ever-growing pace,
                there is more of an opportunity to utalise them. As a retailer you want to think to yourself,
                why do you exist? Why would someone face the icy cold, monsoon rain, mile on mile traffic to come to
                you? If your answer is to buy, then it's time to put a "Sorry we've close down" sign
                outside. Customers don't face the great outdoors for that, buying is something they have to do, not
                what they want to do. They are there to explore, discover, interact.
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
                There is travel store in Europe whereby they have altered the way you transverse around the place.
                They thought OK, what do we sell, what are we about, what do we believe in? With those answers they
                went about constructing their store.  What they came up with is incredible, essentially placing
                biomes inside; A desert, jungle, rocky spaces. One of things they believe is people aught to
                be able to try they their equipment as close as possible to the environment they'll be used in.
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
                So is retail dead? No, the way we're doing it sure is.
