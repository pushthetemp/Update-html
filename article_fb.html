                        This is a quick one, why would I want to waste your time? <br><br>
                        Facebook immersion, what is that? In this case it's reefing to the platforms 360 tools.
                        It along with YouTube are the best so far in terms of being able to showcase vr content. Facebook
                        your able to make it to with its dedicated camera tool.
                        as a result, you can have much more interesting photos videos on your page. <br><br>
    
                        360 photos are awesome for live events, and scenery especially - taking in much more of the
                        environment you would not normally get with your standalone photo. Further, if you're in the
                        hospitality or service business you could too benefit from such a feature, whereby you can show a
                        room/paces in its entirety and hopefully making it easier to seal the deal. <br> <br>
    
                        The bottom line is the fact you able to provide much more visual information, you bring your
                        audience that little bit closer to you, not to mention that people will 100% spend much longer on
                        your post because of this immersive experience- especially if you start having fun with it and hid
                        things in the scene for people to look around and find- I mean come on, where's wally has just got
                        a whole punch more interesting right??? That right there is a solid idea, if you're a clothing brand
                        this could be a great fun game- playing a whereâ€™s wally-type thing with the 360 cameras. You dress a
                        guy in your exclusive gear, or just one flagship item, put them in a crowded location and your
                        audience need to look through these 360 photos to find said person. Should they find them, maybe you
                        could give them a voucher, or a discount code of the item or the store in whole. There, don't say
                        I never give you anything. <br><br>
    
                        The main thing is you need to Bring different, Push different. When you change the way, you look at
                        things, the things you look at change. <br><br>
