                Retail is in decline, well, so they say. But why do they say this though?
                because what you get online is much quicker, easier, and I guess, much more enjoyable than what you
                would have to face in the store.
            </p>

            <p id="copy">
                Hold one second- "store". When we think of this word I can bet not may of us have dynamic images in our
                heads. I bet there's the isles, shelves, counter, register, a big window, a bunch of posters and maybe a
                slight theme running though it. Or, I won't be too negative, maybe there's a strong, interesting vibrant
                theme, however the way the activity is being implemented/played out is much the same as it was back in
                1610.
                Find what you want, take it off the shelf, shimmy over to the merchant, pay, then out you go. Based on
                that,
                why wouldn't you just do it online, what you're doing is so monotonous anyway. Then you have the folks
                over
                at Amazon thinking different. And that's what this article is about, brining difference in a world of
                sameness when it comes to retail.
            </p>

            <p id="copy">
                Lets jump back over to the amazon thing and see why they're showing us something slightly different. I
                said
                above the basic steps when you walk into a store. With Amazon Go (that's its name) you skip the part of
                going to the merchant, and jut go. Nothing to it. It's like having a gigantic kitchen I guess you would
                say.

            </p>

            <p id="copy">
                However, what they what people do in the store is the same as any other super market. I don't see myself
                running over to an amazon Go any time soon- unless I really need something. In fact, I may find it a
                little
                worrying because I don't even apply the motion to implement contactless anymore, at least with that you
                can
                feel yourself spending more and more. Then realize you freaking huge bill when you check your phone the
                next
                day or something. As I said at least Amazon are keeping to the spirit of bringing difference in a world
                of
                sameness and brining us the future store.
            </p>

            <p id="copy">
                Retail shouldn't just be seen as a place to purchace items, It should be more of a journey and
                experience
                into a new world. Especially now more than ever with online doing an amazing job of solving problems in
                style . We used to walk miles to go to town because we could hold something that we've never held
                before,
                see something we've never seen before, interact with people we've never interacted before. The keyword
                back
                then was NEW. New is harder to achieve now. Different, I think is a much more achievable goal. You can
                make
                an environment different, you can make the way you transvers around different, like with Amazon, you can
                make the payment method different.
            </p>

            <p id="copy">
                With the development of future technologies being brought to the public at an ever-growing pace, there
                is
                more of an opportunity to being to utalise them. As a retailer you want to think to yourself, why do you
                exist. Why would someone face the icy cold, monsoon rain, traffic piled up fpr miles on end to come to
                you?
                If your answer is to buy, then it's time to put a "Sorry we've close down" sign outside. Customers don't
                face the great outdoors for that, they are the are there to explore, discover.
            </p>

            <p id="copy">
                Ok, I have couple examples of some companies/brands implementing the future store, applying difference
                in a
                world of sameness, lets have a looks shall we?
            </p>

                We have a travel store in Europe whereby they have altered the way you transvers around the place. They
                though ok, what do we sell, what are we about, what do we believe in? With those answers they went about
                constructing their store. What they came up with is incredible, essentially placing biomes inside. A
                desert, jungle, rocky. Because one of things they believed was that people aught to be able to try they
                their equipment in as close as possible to the environment they'll be using it in. It's like having a
                wind tunnel but for your great.

                So is ratial dead? No, the way we're doing it sure is though.
