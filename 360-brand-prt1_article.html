               360 is not a binary state. Meaning, it doesn't just involve things of a digital nature i.e. video,
                mixed reality, virtual reality etc. In this case, it refers to being immersed or completely captivated
                by where you are within that moment in time. A good movie has the power to do this to the point when you
                leave; you forget you’re on earth. That’s video. Retail stores can be 360 too, this is when you don't
                straight away realise the place you have gone to buy your milk is actually a store. Why? Because you 
                passed two cows, a disco and a herd of goats on the way in. 360 is different, and captivates more emotions
                than your standard.  
            </p>


            <p id="copy">
                A 360 brand takes the principles from above and applies it to your company. Now, I have come up with a case
                study for you- don't say I never treat you. For this one, we'll look at giving HMV a 360 brad and to make
                sure this article doesn't run too long, it form a series where the first will mainly be covering the
                mission statement.
            </p>

            <p id="copy">
               Opening, we start with what the company is about; what's their mission, macro and micro goals to get
               achieving said mission? What inspires them? What makes them laugh, cry, angry? What makes them unlike
               anyone else? 
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
               Note: That last one “What makes them unlike anyone else?” often catches people out, so I’ll help out super
               quickly. It revolves around your methodology or maybe the kind of team you have- boasting the smartest by
               far in your market, the most aggressive in terms of willingness to face uncertainty and be open-minded
               about things. You could go on and on, but neither of us have all day, so that's the sort of thing you
               look at when outlining this. Let's have a look at HMV's vision/mission and the customer. 
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
               HMV is the home of entertainment.  (I think) Its vision lies in becoming the hub for new discovery.<br><br> 
               Whenever you think of HMV, you associate flicking through their racks looking for music, DVD's etc.; it's one
               of the few stores you venture into without a focused intent, other than the goal to find something you'll like.
               It's a place for the individual as well as established communities.  
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
               It’s good to include you’re ideal customer within your vision, especially through the sheer fact without them;
               you have zero company, let alone brand. You want to know who are they, what do they like doing, who are their
               MVP's (who they admire the most), what are their spending habits? Do they venture in packs or in a group? Let’s
               pretend that we've conducted meticulous research here and we know it like the back of our hands. 
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
               It's not the best to rely on what you do base on pure demographics: age, race, education level etc. rather, base
               the majority off psychographics which involves the elements mentioned at the beginning of this segment
               (i.e. common goals). That way you don’t limit the potential people you can reach; instead include people developing
               more and more dynamic and non-corresponding lives. Some just love music in its entirety whereby you'll see them 
               browsing the shelves for Hip-Hip one second, then the next, they’re picking up a vinyl by Metallica. If you were 
               to plot these people on a graph it would simply be filled with anomalies.  
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
               Ask yourself why things are the way they are. The reason they may be going to such contrasting genres and artist
               in terms of sound may be more related to the purpose for the music, or their ideology. Maybe they love nostalgic music.
               So heck yeah, now I understand why they go to Wu-Tang-Klan then. They are individuals that want to experience things
               that they don't get online; the look, feel and atmosphere. They like bumping into someone followed by spontaneous 
               conversation. The age, you get everyone from 4 year olds looking for their Mr Men mug, to 14 year-olds on a mission 
               to get their latest poster for their room.  
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
                The point is HMV serves many. And what their customers are looking for is unique, different, something for the
                die-hard fans as well as the experimental. Where else do you go to find a Walking Dead doormat along with the Sound
                track to the series with the extra themed mug just for good measure? I would only ever think of one place. I guess you
                could phrase it as "Entering a world of worlds".
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
                I think this very iconic store has forgotten what made them so iconic in the first place. Thankfully their new owner
                Doug Putman understand the importance of HMV’s regeneration/revival, as well as the revival or retail in general, giving
                the nod to looking at implementing new technologies and experiences, engaging more with their current community, as well
                as forming new and stronger relationships. Under the watchful eye of Doug, HVM could once again be able to play a track
                we can all sing along to. Tell the dog, his master has a new voice.
