                Let's look at inner cities, if you were to compare the look and feel of one in the 1980's, then compare
                one today (2019), you wouldn't see as big a difference as you might think. Yes the quality may have greatly
                increased, yes there are more big screens in the center squares,  not much more from that. What you do there
                and how you transverse in these cities is essentially the same. I guess this is a similar to a classroom in
                1810 and one of 2019 , we won't go into that one just yet.
            </p>

                Compare a phone in the 1980's to 2019, now that's what you call change. Come to think of it, the advancements of
                products have done incredibly well in nearly 40 years. To the point we're actively and confidently looking to
                implement Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) to the wider market soon enough- especially with movies
                like Ready Player One giving the nod to such progressions. 
            </p>

            <p id="copy">
                Architecture within cities themselves have changed, however,  and a lot too. Although, what we do in them and how
                we interact have very much stayed similar or the same.  By interaction we're talking walking round a
                shopping center, how we buy, the way we feel when we go to a restaurant, the gym, any activity. Check out "Future
                Sore" to see some alterations retail can make to create a world as interesting as the architecture within it's situated.
            </p>
            
             <p id="copy">
                 It seem the world of architecture is one of the few when handed a project  ask, "what if?", then actually implement it.
                 Sure others ask this too,  not to the point of action (understandably it can be as a result of a governing body of some sort).
                 The architects truly bend and warp the environment they are put in, from designers like Bijarke Igles to Santiago Calatrava or even
                 the great Zaha Hadid, truly envision a very alternative world with "different" woven within the DNA of their projects.
                 Even you more local, home grown architects are doing a great job altering our urbanscapes for the better.  
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
                Architects thought process transitions from 'what do people think?' to 'what do we what them to think?'. 'What do they feel?' to 'what we want
                them to feel?', 'What do they do  to what do want them to do?'. Sometimes to interact with a building you have to completely ditch what
                you're used to and adopt a new contrarian approach.  I think we need to get better at making new things, more so , we need to get better at creating different.
                Bringing different and pushing different. Why? because our market depends on it, it's why sales in retail are declining, why you're seeing more restaurants empty.
                But also why the NFL sees some of the biggest crowds in sport, and why the Dubai's and Shanghai's tourism industry is going crazy. 
            </p>
            
            <p id="copy">
                Architecture has and will continue to keep our minds open for centuries to come. It's because of this industry our towns
                and cities enter the next level. This is my opinion. What do you think? Should we start taking note and follow?
